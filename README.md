# SQL-Cart-Asp.net
Login based Shopping Cart using SQL.


Hello, 

Big shout-out to Balram Yadav ( Coder Baba ). is He's an inspiration for me, I learn so much from his videos, basically I learned web designing from his video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuyRWWVx9Ig ) I had some basic knowledge of HTML and little bit of C#, I followed his all parts of ( E-Shopping ASP.NET Website ) and now I have good knowledge of C# and SQL. Again big love and respect for Coder Baba.


1. As I mentioned above that I learned from Coder Baba's ( E-Shopping ASP.NET Website ) tutorials,in that tutorials He used Cookies to store Product ID ( PID ), and in Cart Page we use Cookies array to extract PID and bind all products were added in Cookies using PID.

2. Using Cookies I tried but couldn't find a way to add 2 or more quantities of same product, and also I wanted to make cart which user can access from other devices which is not possible using Cookies.

3. So I decided to make a Cart using SQL, and here it is.

4. Hope this will help others, that's why I'm posting here.
